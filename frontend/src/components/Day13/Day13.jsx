            <p>
                On Day 13, we've introduced a new and engaging feature to our web application â€“ a Comment System. User engagement and interaction are crucial, and comments are a great way to facilitate that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Comment System allows users to post comments on various content sections, articles, or discussions. It's a seamless way for users to share their thoughts, ask questions, or provide feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a glimpse of what we've accomplished:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a Comment Input: We've designed a user-friendly comment input box that adjusts to various screen sizes for a consistent experience.</li>
                <li>Comments List: Users can view existing comments in a neatly organized list, with each comment displayed in a dedicated container.</li>
                <li>Responsiveness: The Comment System is responsive, ensuring it looks and works great on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's a significant step forward in enhancing user engagement and interaction on our web application. Stay tuned for more features and improvements as we continue our coding challenge journey!
