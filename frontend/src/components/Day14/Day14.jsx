            <p>
                On Day 14, we've delved into creating a fundamental component for our web application â€“ the "Product Details" component.
                This component provides detailed information about a product, similar to what you might find on e-commerce platforms like Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Product Details component showcases essential details of a product, including its name, description, price, image, ratings, and reviews.
                We've used dummy data to populate this component, giving you a glimpse of what the final product display might look like.
            </p>
            <p>
                This component's design is not just visually appealing but also responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
            </p>
            <p>
